<p style="text-align:justify;"> Hong Kong is a Special Administrative 
Region of the People's Republic of China, 
and was formerly part of the British 
Empire and Commonwealth of Nations. 
Hong Kong is best known as a shoppers' paradise. 
There is, however, so much more to Hong Kong than shopping. 
Visitors can enjoy views of the city from high altitude, 
sample local food, celebrate festivals, watch sports 
competitions, and visit movie settings in the city
Hong Kong is most famous for being a global 
trade and finance hub. But it's also a 
surprisingly edgy place known for 
great shopping, amazing food, natural 
beauty, lots of attractions, as well 
as its dark history.
